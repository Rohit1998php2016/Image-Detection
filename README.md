# Image-Detection
Recognition using Tensorflow  
Here is a code for recognizing hand written digits using tensorflow. This code is kept as precise as possible.
The data set for the code is taken from tensorflow/examples/datasets
A simple neuralnetwork was built and used to classify the images into their corresponding classes. Visualising the images was also done.
